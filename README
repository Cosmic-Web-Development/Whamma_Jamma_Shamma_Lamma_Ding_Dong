The whole kit-and-kaboodle. It has everything you want and more. Oh, so much more. In fact that 'more' is so much more, it's oozing 'more' out of the 
whazoo. Next.js, Tailwind, GraphQL, Auth, AMP, Blog, Landing, and eCommerce. That is just the tip of this iceburg. Checking it out from behind, it's thicc.
Strapi CMS set up for social media, blog, eCommerce, payment processing with Stripe. We're not stopping there though. Oh no, not even close. 
This Mamma Jamma comes with that deluxe backend. We have a NoSQL database AND relational GraphQL for holding, accessing, updating. 
Admin UX for bossing and businessing. Organic SEO and dynamic, resposive, and mobile first baked right into this hunk of Awesomness. Honestly,
this might just be too much Excellence of Radness. Just happens when We do what We do.
